/**
 * All, Recipes, Cookbooks — the lens on what kind of thing the Library shows.
 *
 * These are permanently on screen rather than revealed on search focus,
 * because under the default sort an old cookbook sinks into the Library just
 * as an old recipe does, and this is the control that finds it again. The Add
 * button's meaning depends on which one is lit, which is the other reason they
 * cannot move back behind a focus state (ADR-0026).
 *
 * They are sized as a control rather than as a label, because that is what
 * they are: a lens that renames the page and changes what the Add button
 * makes has to look at least as substantial as the search field beside it. The
 * unlit ones take a real fill and a border so the group reads as three
 * choices with one of them taken, rather than as one chip and two ghosts.
