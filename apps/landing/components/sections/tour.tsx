 *
 * Which screen is up is the one thing that is not scrubbed: it is committed at
 * the halfway point between two blocks and the change then plays itself out,
 * because a screenshot scrubbed halfway into another screenshot is a blend of
 * two pictures and reads as neither; under reduced motion it is a cut.
 *
 * Held, the scroll may only come to rest on a screen rather than in the middle
 * of a swap, and how far a flick carries in the first place is Lenis's business
 * rather than the phone's (see `app/providers.tsx`).
