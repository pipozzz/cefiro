 * Import, then plan, then cook: a sequence, so it plays like one. The section
 * holds the screen and the page's own scroll walks the rail sideways, a step at
 * a time, resting on each one long enough to read it with the next already
 * ghosting in past the edge. Everything is worked out from where the section
 * sits in the scroll, so it scrubs both ways and never plays to an empty room;
 * under reduced motion the rail snaps between steps instead of sliding.
 *
 * How fast that reads is not decided here. The page's scroll is Lenis's (see
 * `app/providers.tsx`), which is what keeps a flick from carrying the whole
 * sequence past in two frames, and the rests below are where it may stop.
 *
 * Without scripting the rail is exactly what it looks like: a row you swipe
 * yourself, snapping to each step (see `.moments-*` in globals.css).
