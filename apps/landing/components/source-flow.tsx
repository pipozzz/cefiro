 * pushed up against the seam between them: the fan ends where its half does,
 * so the point every strand converges on is the middle of the page, and the
 * recipe it converges on takes the half after it. The sources need less room
 * than the recipe does, so the width of the whole thing is set by the half the
 * recipe wants and the slack is left out at the far edge.
