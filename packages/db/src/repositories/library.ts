 * One paginated list over recipes and cookbooks together — the Library.

 * The union carries only what every sort mode needs (a kind, an id, a title
 * and a creation date) plus the two columns search needs, and the page it
 * lands on is hydrated into full cards afterwards. Ordering, paging and the
 * type filter all happen in SQL, so `total` counts both kinds — nothing may
 * read it as a recipe count — and a page has no gaps and no repeats.
 *
 * Search is the one place the two kinds are not comparable. A cookbook has
 * only a title to offer and `ts_rank` normalises by length, so a matching
 * cookbook is *pinned* above the relevance-ranked recipes rather than scored
 * against them; a reader who unticks Title in "Search in" takes cookbooks out
 * of search entirely, which is the honest reading of that control (ADR-0026).
 *
 * Recipe-only filters — rating, cooking time, categories, tags, favourites —
 * drop cookbooks out the same way a recipe missing that data drops out.
 *
 * The recipe branch's correlated subqueries spell `"recipes"."…"` by hand:
 * an interpolated drizzle column renders unqualified, which inside a
 * subquery resolves to the wrong table and silently matches nothing.
