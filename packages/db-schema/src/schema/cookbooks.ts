 * A Cookbook: a titled set of recipes, and nothing else.
 *
 * It carries a `userId` like a recipe and is seen, edited and deleted under
 * the instance's `RECIPE_PERMISSION_POLICY` rather than a rule of its own
 * (ADR-0027); deleting an account detaches the cookbooks it made instead of
 * destroying them, and an orphaned row is visible to everyone under every
 * policy exactly as an orphaned recipe is.
 *
 * There is deliberately no cover column and no description. The cover is
 * derived at read time from the members' own images, so it can never go
 * stale and there is nothing to upload.
